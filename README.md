# Breakout-Game

    • First, I started with creating the paddle for the player, then the movement mechanism, the ball and lastly the blocks on the screen that the ball will hit.
    • The hardest part was creating blocks and their rows, as you need to specify the x and y position for each block in each row. The easiest part was to create the ball and its movement mechanism.
    • Improvement should be in making the collision detection between the paddle and the ball more accurate as the relay on the distance that is calculated from the both centre points of the both and it was hard to achieve that with the inclusion of the bouncing regarding to the ball hitting the wall.
    • The turtle library corelation of the axes is not accurate or is hard to get to a certain point, so that you have to settle to a coordination value that will work as best for your program as possible.
